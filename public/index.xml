      <description>Android Development I develop native Android apps for clients. For the apps I build, I keep the code clean and the user interface simple. When I work with customers, I like to build early prototypes and quick MVPs for trying out features and improving usability early in the process. I like building appealing user interfaces, and try to stick to Material Design. I am using state-of-the-art technologies and architectural patterns, and always strive for clean code, so that it stays maintainable also for my successor developers.</description>
