### Android Development

I develop native Android apps for clients. For the apps I build, I keep the code clean and the user interface simple. When I work with customers, I like to build early prototypes and quick MVPs for trying out features and improving usability early in the process. I like building appealing user interfaces, and try to stick to Material Design. I am using state-of-the-art technologies and architectural patterns, and always strive for clean code, so that it stays maintainable also for my successor developers.

### Web Development

I can build websites and web applications for you. I am fluent in JavaScript, Typescript, Node.js,  HTML and CSS, and know most common frameworks, tools and environments. If you need your own website, or a system where you and your colleagues can log in and manage your work, I can develop that for you.  
I have a good understanding of user interface design and usability, however, I am not a designer. I can create a nice looking website, but if you want your system to look shiny and consistent with your corporate design, you might need to hire a professional designer for that job. I know colleagues who can help you with that.

### Consulting

If you need someone for consultation on technical problems for a software project, I can help you with that. I can answer critical questions for planning a project, and assess the feasability or size of a project or certain features. Whether you need a quick app or website that displays some content, or a bigger project that requires multiple developers and more time, I have the expertise to help you plan it. 

### Training

Sometimes non-tech staff needs some insight into their companies technologies, for making sense of the buzzwords they are hearing all the time. I do in-house trainings to give you exactly this. Depending on the technology stack of your company, I give you an overview about how these technologies work together, and some hands-on training on coding and the typical infrastructure.
