The more I learn, the more I see what I don't know yet. I realize how much I could improve my situation, if I just learn this other thing. I get glimpses of what's possible, and I want to reach there.

I'm a software developer who founded a coding school a couples of years ago. I don't have a formal education in business, so I need to constantly learn.

And everytime I learn, I see what else I could improve, what else I could learn. I take online classes on finances, I read books and listen to podcasts on leadership, and I ask people for their advice on business and leadership issues.

When looking back, I had a lot of moments where I realized that we already came a long way. I already learned a huge amount! The business improved, the quality of our teaching was raised, and I grew a lot as a person.

But never have I had the feeling that I arrived. I don't arrive, I don't settle. I need to constantly go on and learn the next thing. Because once you start learning, you will see the next steps. And you can't but take these steps, go forward growing and getting even better, and help others do the same.

This feeling is incredible. It gives you motivation, energy, and self-respect.

I want to share that with you, so I will publish my learnings here. I want to inspire you to do the same: go on a jouney of ongoing learning experience and growth.

The first learning:  

**Once you start learning, you want to learn more.**

So go on and buy that book, take that class, read that blog post or listen to that podcast. Intentionally learn, enjoy the feeling of the learning moment, and then look for the next learning opportunity.

If you do that continuously, you will be amazed about what you can achieve.
