## 1. The Question

Your job is threatened by Corona. Should you switch career and become a developer?

- switching careers is a big step
- be sure you know what you are getting yourself into
- in this video I will be very blunt with you
- instead of advertising the job of a software developer, I will speak the truth
- show you the obstacles that you need to expect
- no bullshit

## 2. The Meat

- there are obstacles to becoming a developer
- some students stop mid-way, because they couldn't overcome it

### 1. Competition

- a couple of years ago, there was a super high demand for software developers
- companies were desperate for developers
- Germany needed more, since digitalization is going on
- the universities' Bachelor/Master programs couldn't create able developers

- now it is different
- the wave of coding bootcamps that started in the US has reached Germany
- there is a wave of bootcamp graduates that is filling the market
- job centers are financing these courses
- graduates aren't always on the level of Junior Developer that companies need
- there are quite a number of job-seeking coding course graduates out there

- if you want to enter this field, you need to take that into account
- you need to stand out - preferably with your skills
- present your skills publicly: your own website, your GitHub etc.
- create projects for yourself, show that you can code
- expect that the search for a job takes a while (up to 6 months)
- expect that you need to put effort into the process of going from graduate to Junior Dev
- expect that you need to work on your own projects first to demonstrate your abilities

### 2. Frustration

- one of the biggest enemies of software development students is frustration
- as with any difficult undertaking, you can get overwhelmed and frustrated
- the choice of tools is overwhelming
- the abundance of new things you have to learn is overwhelming
- not finding the error (the bug) in your code is frustrating
- and seeing that you fail when your classmates succeed with coding tasks can just be outright demotivating

- you need to be patient and persistent
- ever watched a kid figuring out how a new toy works?
- they are not afraid to try out every possible way
- test out angles, get very creative with it
- they don't stop if it doesn't work
- this is the attitude that you need
- don't be afraid to play around with things and make it fail
- you will experience the pleasure of success soon enough

### 3. Age

- as mundane as it sounds:
- older people usually learn things much different than young people
- the reason is what psychology calls `learned helplessness` 
- the older you are, the more you have probably failed in using technology
- younger people don't have this experience of failure yet
- so they don't assume they will fail if they touch technology

- with learning to code it's similar
- learning a programming language is like learning a language
- the younger you are, the easier it comes to you
- if you are a young adult - go for it
- if you are older (40 and beyond), you can do it as well
- but you have to expect that:
  - you learn different than your classmates
  - you are slower than your classmates
  - you might encounter more frustration and fear
- the only way to overcome this is to always keep an open mind
- nourish the child inside you, be creative
- be persistent and patient

### 4. A Tight Schedule

- you need time to learn coding
- it's a creative thing
- you inevitable need time to play around with it
- if your schedule is too packed and you can't make time for learning: don't do it

### 5. False Expectations

- you need to know what you are getting yourself into
- software development is a whole new world
- thousands of options
  - web development
  - mobile development
  - application development
  - back-end development
  - DevOps
  - ...
- and it is ever-evolving
- things change all the time
- you will need to keep learning all the time
- you will know what it is like to be a developer
- you will work on your computer 8h/day
- highly virtual world!
- very logical, unemotional world
- most of the time you will fix bugs
- your learning curve might be flat - progress might be slow
- you will be frustrated on a regular basis - you need to know how to deal with it
- burnout rate is high - you need to be resilient
- you need to know how it feels like and if you like it
- you need to like it, or you will fail
- and the failure will be expensive (time, money)

### Summary:

- you need to know what your are getting yourself into
- you need to know if you like coding
- if you do already, perfect - go for it
- if you don't know / you are not sure, figure it out first

- if you are located in North of Germany you can visit one of our Trial Lessons at Hamburg Coding School
- if not, try some online classes first
- there are good and free courses out there

## 3. The Benediction

- I hope this wasn't too demotivating
- I wish for you that you can figure out if this is a career choice for you
- I will help you with it - write a comment, I answer all of them
- if you are in Hamburg/Northern Germany come to our Trial Lesson
- I hope you find a career change that suits you
- that you will find a secure job in this difficult time
- keep on going!
