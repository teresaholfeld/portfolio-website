I'm a freelance software developer. I'm best at native Android development, but I do web development (JavaScript, Node, Databases, HTML, CSS) as well. 

I run my own side-business, [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/), where I organize and teach courses on coding for adults. 

I'm based in Hamburg, Germany. I take on contracts here or remotely.
